    This is the fixed 6 for version 1.
    I add two macro in the bootloader.
    	1. read_disk: use the interrupt to read disk to memory.
   	2. reboot: If  double error when read_disk, use the macro to reboot.
    Also I modified some of the label.
	1. cal_FAT_1 => reminder_1
	2. cal_FAT_2 => reminder_2
	3. add cmp_FAT

   The purpose of this fixed is to reduce the code size of the bootloader.
   As we all know that the bootloader only has 512 bytes, so we need to 
   use the code carefully.

    This is the fixed 5 for version 1
    OK, this may be the final version of the bootloader.
    There may still have many bug, but the outline is just like this.
	
    1. load the root dir into the disk buffer
       a. no huge bug in this section
       b. add a conditional jump to avoid the reading error

    2. search the kernel.bin
       a. fortunately, there is no bug in this section

    3. after finding the kernel.bin, get the fat number
        no bug in this section

    4. I add some new code to calculate the FAT number, and the sector the binary is using.

    this is the fixed 4 for version 1
    add severl additional feature
    1. load the root dir into the disk buffer
    2. search the kernel.bin
    3. after finding the kernel.bin, get the fat number

    that's all for this fix

    this is the fixed 3 version 1
    servel bug fixed from fixed 2 version 1
    1. addw $1, %ax => addw $1, %dx
    2. del servel code since they are useless
    (when claculating head, the first two lines no need to be calculate again)
    3. add xor %dx, %dx before divw $HPT
    the lba2chs function seems to be complete,
    the only problem may occur when the cyliner is to big and need to use the 2 MSB of the cl register.
    I hope this won't happened. XD

   this is the fixed 2 version 1
   add a new function call (lba2chs) in the bootloader
